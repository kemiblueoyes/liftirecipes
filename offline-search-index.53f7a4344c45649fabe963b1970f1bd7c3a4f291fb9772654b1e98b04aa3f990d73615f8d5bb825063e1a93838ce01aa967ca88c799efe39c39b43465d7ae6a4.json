You can use multiple % in a row to indicate an exact number of characters that need to be matched. Examples:\nfoo* would match occurrences of food and football *ing would match drifting and flying %%%ld would match could and mould (but not should, because it has 4 letters before the ld) %%p* matches words starting with any two characters followed by g, then any zero or more characters, e.g. map, caps, duped And (\u0026) The and operator (\u0026) Performs an intersection of two intermediate query results, combining word positions for successful matches.\nFood \u0026 Burger searches for items containing both \"food\" and \"burger\" at any position, and in any field.\n(Alternatively Food Burger will have the same effect as the default operator between query parts is an \u0026.)\nOr (|) Performs a union of two intermediate query results.

This can value can be controlled by specifying a number, e.g. ~4 to restrict to only returning results within 4 words of one another.\ncheese ~ cake will return items containing the words \"cheese\" and \"cake\" in either order, up to 5 words apart, e.g. \"the cake was made with cheese\" and \"I like cheese and cake\" would both match, but \"cake is never to be considered a substitute for cheese\" would not.\nNear following (~\u003e and ~n\u003e) Same as Near (~) except that order is important in the positional intersection.\ncheese ~\u003e cake will match \"cheese and cake\" but not \"cake and cheese\"\nFollowing (\u003e) Same as Near Following (~\u003e) except there are no constraints on how far apart the words can be.\ncheese \u003e cake will match any text where \"cheese\" precedes \"cake\" in a given field.\n","excerpt":"Quick examples Example Meaning West West must appear in the text …","ref":"/lifti/docs/searching/lifti-query-syntax/","title":"The LIFTI Query Syntax"},{"body":"First you will need to make sure that the index is deserialized before use, as demonstrated here, and add an index modification hook to serialize the index whenever a new snapshot is created.\n","excerpt":"First you will need to make sure that the index is deserialized before …","ref":"/lifti/docs/serialization/automatic-serialization/","title":"Automatic Serialization"},{"body":"index.BeginBatchChange(); await index.AddAsync(1, \"This is some text associated with A: fizz\"); await index.AddAsync(2, \"Some buzz text for B\"); await index.AddAsync(3, \"Text associated with C is both fizz and buzz\"); await index.CommitBatchChangeAsync(); Only once CommitBatchChangeAsync has been called will the new data be available in the index for searching.

The distance between two words is the number of edits that are required to match them, including:\ninsertions: fid would match find deletions: foood would match food substitutions: frnd would match find transpositions: fnid would match find - Transpositions are a special case, because although two characters are affected, it is considered a single edit. The resulting Levenshtein distance between any matched term and the search term is used to reduce the score of the match. This means that documents containing words that are closer matches will typically be surfaced higher up in the search results.\nConfiguration To prevent a combinatorial explosion of potential matches, LIFTI provides two control mechanisms for fuzzy matching:\nMaximum number of edits - the total number of edits that can be used in any potential match. The default for this value is calculated as search term length/2. Maximum number of sequential edits - the maximum number of edits that can be found sequentially in any potential match. The default for this value is calculated as search term length/4. For example, with a max edits of 3 and max sequential edits of 1:\nfeed will not match food because it requires two sequential edits redy will not match friendly because it requires 4 insertions Default values can be configured at the index level, and can either be expressed as a static value, or a value calculated from the length of the search term.\n","excerpt":"Fuzzy matches can be explicitly searched for using the LIFTI query …","ref":"/lifti/docs/searching/fuzzy-matching/","title":"Fuzzy Matching"},{"body":"Indexing text As shown in this example, if all you have is a key and text to be indexed for it, you can just make use one of the AddAsync overloads that operate on strings - there is no need to construct any artificial objects in order to populate the index.\nEach of these methods will use the default text extraction and tokenization configured for the index and the default field id, IFullTextIndex.FieldLookup.DefaultField.\nTask AddAsync(TKey itemKey, string text) Adds an item to the index treating the single string as the complete document text.\nTask AddAsync(TKey itemKey, IEnumerable\u003cstring\u003e text) Adds an item to the index with multiple text fragments. Each fragment is considered to be fragments of the same text, i.e. the index and offset of tokens increments across the elements in the IEnumerable\u003cstring\u003e.\nIt’s worth noting that each fragment is processed independently, so an implicit word break exists between element. This means that AddAsync(1, new[ \"a\", \"b\" ]) will index two words (a and b) whereas if the two strings had been naively concatenated together, only one (ab) would, as there was no word break between them.\nIndexing Objects In order to index an object against the index it needs to have first been configured when the index was built, using WithObjectTokenization.

Snapshots: Whenever changes are committed to the index, a read-only snapshot is taken.

You can do this using either the ITokenizer for the index, or if specific tokenization rules have been configured for a field, then the tokenizer for that field:\nvar tokenizer = index.DefaultTokenizer; var query = new Query( new AndQueryOperator( new ExactWordQueryPart(tokenizer.Normalize(\"hello\")), new ExactWordQueryPart(tokenizer.Normalize(\"there\")))); Query Parts IQueryParts come in two flavors:\nOperators - these contain other IQueryParts, combining the results that they return according to certain rules, e.g. AndQueryPart and OrQueryPart Textual - these work the IIndexNavigator to query the index for matches appropriate to them, e.g. ExactWordQueryPart, FuzzyMatchQueryPart. Textual query parts ExactWordQueryPart(string word) Searches the index for words that exactly match word.\nFuzzyMatchQueryPart(string word, ushort maxEditDistance = 4, ushort maxSequentialEdits = 1) ? in LIFTI query syntax\nPerforms a fuzzy match against the index.\nmaxEditDistance: The maximum of edits allowed for any given match.

They can be constructed using the following methods:\nWildcardQueryFragment.MultiCharacter() - matches zero or more characters in the index. WildcardQueryFragment.SingleCharacter() - matches any single character in the index. WildcardQueryFragment.CreateText(string text) - exact matches a fragment of text at whatever point has been reached in the index. For example:\nvar wildcard = new WildcardQueryPart(new[] { WildcardQueryFragment.SingleCharacter(), WildcardQueryFragment.SingleCharacter(), WildcardQueryFragment.CreateText(\"d\") }) Would translate to the LIFTI query %%d, matching any words that start with any two letters followed by a d.\nStructural query parts AndQueryOperator(IQueryPart left, IQueryPart right) \u0026 in LIFTI query syntax\nIntersects the results of two query parts.
